## Tú Commands (you, informal)
### Positive
Conjugate in the él/ella form, unless the verb is one of the following.
| Word  | Tú (positive) form |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| venir | ven                |
| decir | di                 |
| salir | sal                |
| hacer | haz                |
| tener | ten                |
| ir    | ve                 |
| poner | pon                |
| ser   | sé                 |
| ver   | ve                 |
| dar   | da                 |
| estar | está               |
| saber | sepa               |

If the verb has any pronouns (me, te, lo, la, los, las, nos, le, les), add them to the end of the conjugated verb and add an accent on the third-to-last syllable.

## Tú (negative), Usted (you, formal), Ustedes (you all)
1. Go to "yo"
2. Drop the "o"
3. Flip-flop the endings

That is to say, go to the yo form of the verb, drop the "o" from the end, and flip the endings, so that if it was an -AR verb, it ends in "E", and if it was an -ER/-IR verb, it would end in "A".

The endings are listed below.
| Form          | Ending    |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Tú (negative) | as/es     |
| Usted         | a/e       |
| Ustedes       | an/en     |
| Nosotros      | amos/emos |

If the verb has any pronouns (me, te, lo, la, los, las, nos, le, les) and the verb is positive, add them to the end of the conjugated verb and add an accent on the third-to-last syllable. If the verb is negative, add the pronoun before the word.

If it's a -car, -gar, or -zar verb, make the spelling change as necessary.

### Irregular Yo Verbs
- If a verb ends in -ger or -gir, the G changes to a J in the yo form
  - Examples: escoger => escojo, recoger => recojo
- If a verb ends in -cer or -cir, the verb ends in "zco" in the yo form
  - Examples: traducir => traduzco, conducir => conduzco, conocer => conozco
- If a verb ends in -guir, the verb loses the o in the yo form
  - Example: seguir => sigo
- -GO verbs
  - Venir (vengo)
  - Decir (Digo)
  - Salir (Salgo)
  - Hacer (Hago)
  - Tener (Tengo)
  - Poner (Pongo)
  - Oir (Oigo)
  - Caer (Caigo)
- Estar (esté)
- Saber (sepa)

## Nosotros
Like the tú (negative), usted, and ustedes forms, the conjugation for nosotros is going to the "yo" form, dropping the "o", and flip-flopping the ending. Verbs ending in -car, -gar, or -zar, still change. However, if the verb is a stem-changer, it only changes if the verb is an -IR verb. -AR and -ER verbs do not stem change.

If the verb is reflexive, remember that the ending will be "monos".
