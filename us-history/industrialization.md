- Refers to the greatly-increased output of machine-made goods
- Replaced the cottage industry
- Three "must-haves" to industralize
  - Also known as "factors of production"
  - Example: Britain
    - Land
      - Climate is good for textile production
      - Lots of natural resources (e.g. coal)
    - Labour
      - Growing population
      - Many moving to cities, away from rural areas
    - Capital
      - Internal trade encouraged
      - Helped build canals/roads
- Natural Resources (U.S.)
  - Oil ("black gold")
    - Found in Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, and Texas
    - Used for kerosene (lamps), gasoline byproduct (dumped, no ICE)
  - Coal/iron ore
    - Found in the Midwest
    - Used for fuel and building material
    - Iron: dense, soft, fragile, tends to rust
      - Removing carbon made it stronger, more flexible, lighter, and rust-resistant
      - Smelted into steel via the Bessemer process
        - Used for farming, architecture, and construction (e.g. bridges and skyscrapers)
- Vertical Integration
  - Control all aspects of one production
    - E.g. SpaceX
    - Buy out suppliers
    - Own manufacturing plants
    - Controlled distribution
- Horizontal Integration
  - Control all of one aspect of production
