## Distance and Displacement
- Displacement: How far something is from its original position
  - Initial: \(x_{0}\)
  - Final: \(x \text{ or } x_{F}\)
- Average Speed: \(\frac{\text{distance travelled}}{\text{time}}\)
- Average Velocity: \(\frac{\text{displacement}}{\text{time}}\)

## Acceleration
- Acceleration (\(a\))
  - Measures the rate at which velocity changes as a fraction of time
