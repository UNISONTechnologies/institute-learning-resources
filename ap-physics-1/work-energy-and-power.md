- Work (\(W\))
  - Work transfers energy from one object to another
  - Work done on on an object (or system of objects) changes the amount of energy had by that object
  - \(W = (x - x_{0})F\)
  - Unit: Joules (J)
  - \(W = \overrightarrow{d} \cdot \overrightarrow{F} = dF \text{ } cos \text{ } \theta\)
    - Large if \(\overrightarrow{d} // \overrightarrow{F}\)
  - If motion moves along the x-axis: \(W = (x - x_{0})F_{x}\)
  - When you do work on an object, you can change the (kinetic) energy of the object
    - \(W = K_{f} - K_{0}\)
  - **Showing your work**
    - \(W = E - E_{0} = 0 \text{ } J\)
      - Work would cause a change in the total energy of the system. No work is done on this system.
    - \(E_{0} = E\)
      - The total energy of this system remains unchanged (conserved)
    - \(K_{0} + U_{0} = K + U\)
      - The total energy of this system is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies
    - \(\frac{1}{2}m\cancel{{v_{0}}^2} + mgy_{0} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + mg\cancel{y}\)
      - The kinetic energy depends on mass and velocity
        - \(K_{0}\) is 0 when the system isn't moving
      - The potential energy depends on mass and height
        - \(U_{0}\) is 0 when the system is as low as possible
    - \(mgy_{0} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2\)
      - Note: Watch out for the \(\frac{1}{2}\) and the squared velocity
- Kinetic Energy (\(K\), \(K_{e}\), \(T\))
  - Energy of motion
  - Formula: \(K = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}\)
- Temperature (Kelvin) is the average kinetic energy per particle
- Potential Energy (\(U\), \(P_{e}\))
  - Energy of relative position
  - Energy had by an object (or system of objects) due to its relative position
  - Formula is the same as work or \(U = mg(y - y_{0})\)
    - \(y_{0}\) is the lowest position of an object
      - May also be \(h\) (height)
    - If the lowest position is 0, then \(U = mgy\)
  - Formula for springs: \(U = \frac{1}{2}kx^2\) or \(U = \frac{1}{2}k(x_{1} - x_{0})^2\)
    - \(x_{0}\) is the equilibrium position
- Springs
  - \(F \rightarrow x\) (linear function)
  - Formula: \(F = kx\) or \(F = k(x - x_{0})\)
    - \(x - x_{0}\) is how far the spring has been displaced from its **equilibrium position**
    - \(k\) is the **spring constant**, a measure of how stiff/rigid the spring is
      - Unit is Newton per meter (\(\frac{N}{m}\))
    - \(F = -kx\) is how hard the spring is pushing back
    - \(W = (x - x_{0})(\frac{1}{2}k(x - x_{0}))\)
      - If the original position is 0, the formula simplifies to \(\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}\)
      - \(W = \int_{0}^{x} \,kx \,dx\)
      - \(W = U\), or potential energy stored in a spring
        - Work done compressing spring = potential energy in a spring
- Total (mechanical) energy (\(E\))
  - Total energy of a system can be changed by doing work on the system
  - Formula: \(E = K + U\)
      - \(W = E - E_{0}\)
        - \(W = K + U - K_{0} + U_{0}\)
      - \(W = (x - x_{0})F_{x}\)
- If no work is done on a system of objects, then total energy remains constant
  - **Conservation of energy** (first major conservation law)
- Conservative versus non-conservative forces
  - The work done against a conservative force is independent of the path taken
  - Example:
    - Conservative: gravity
    - Non-conservative: friction
- Power (\(P\))
  - The rate at which work is done or rate of which energy is transformed/changed
  - Formula: \(P = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{time to do work}} = \frac{W}{t}\)
  - Unit: Watt (\(W\)), Joule per second (\(\frac{J}{s}\))
    - \(1 \text{ } W = 1 \text{ } \frac{J}{s}\))
