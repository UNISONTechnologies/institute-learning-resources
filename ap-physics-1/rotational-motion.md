## Part I
- Position
  - Displacement
    - Variable: \(x, y, z\)
    - Unit: metres
  - Angular displacement
    - Variable: \(\theta\)
    - Unit: radians (\(rad\))
- How fast an object is moving
  - Velocity
    - Variable: \(v\)
    - Unit: \(\frac{m}{s}\)
  - Angular velocity
    - Variable: \(\omega\)
    - Unit: \(\frac{rad}{s}\)
- How quickly an object changes speed
  - Acceleration
    - Variable: \(a\)
    - Unit: \(\frac{m}{s^2}\)
    - Formulas:
      - \(a = \frac{v - v_{0}}{t}\)
      - \(v = v_{0} + at\)
  - Angular acceleration
    - Variable: \(\alpha\)
    - Unit: \(\frac{rad}{s^2}\) (radians over seconds squared)
    - Formulas:
      - \(\alpha = \frac{\omega - \omega_{0}}{t}\)
      - \(\omega = \omega_{0} + {\alpha}t\)
- Types of motion
  - Translational motion
    - From one location to another
    - Force causes a change (push/pull)
  - Rotational motion
    - From one position to another
    - Torque causes a change (twist)
- Torque (\(\tau\))
  - Formula: \(\tau = x_{ap}F_{ap}\)
    - Vector: \(\overrightarrow{\tau} = \overrightarrow{r} \times \overrightarrow{F}\)
    - Vector (alternate): \(\tau = x_{ap} \times F_{apy}\)
      - Cross-product
  - Depends on:
    - The amount of force
    - Where force is applied (in relation to the rotation point)
  - Unit: Newton-metres
  - Direction matters
  - A force applied, in line with a particular point, will not cause a torque around that point
- Net torque (\(\tau_{net}\))
  - The sum of torques about a point on a system
  - If there is no acceleration, the net force is equal to 0 Newtons
  - If there is no angular accleration, the net torque is equal to 0 Newton-metres
  
## Part II
- Acceleration (\(a\))
  - How dramatically the translational motion of an object changes
- \(F = ma\)
  - \(a\): how dramatic the change in translational is
  - \(m\): inertia, how resistant the object is to changes in translational motion
- Angular acceleration (\(\alpha\))
  - How dramatically the rotational motion of an object changes
- \(\tau = I\alpha\)
  - \(\alpha\): how dramatic the change in rotational motion is
  - \(I\): the momemnt of inertia/rotational inertica
- Moment of Inertia (\(I\))
  - The greater the mass, the greater the object's resistance to changes in rotational motion
  - The greater the distance between the mass and the rotation point, the greater the object's resistance to changes in rotational motion
  - \(I = \text{mass} \times \text{radius}^2\)
    - \(I = mr^2\)
  - Unit: kilogram-metres squared (\(kgm^2\))
- Energy
  - Translational kinetic energy: \(\frac{1}{2}mv^2\)
  - Rotational kinetic energy: \(\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2\)
  - Translational work: \(W = (x - x_{0})F\)
  - Rotational work: \(W = (\theta - \theta_{0})\tau\)
- Momentum (\(p\))
  - Quantification of translational motion in an object/system
  - \(p = mv\)
  - Unit: \(\frac{kgm}{s}\) (kilogram-metres over seconds)
  - \(F = \frac{p_{f} - p_{0}}{t}\)
  - Force changes momentum
- Angular momentum (\(L\))
  - Quantification of rotational motion in an object/system
  - Unit:\(\frac{kgm^2}{s^2}\) (kilogram-metres squared over seconds squared)
  - \(L = I\alpha\)
  - \(\tau = \frac{L_{f} - L_{0}}{t}\)
  - Torque changes angular momentum
- Changes in velocity are observable without a net external force
- If no net torque is applied to a system, there is no change in angular momentum, therefore, angular momentum is conserved
  - **Conservation of angular momentum**
  - Third conservation law
- \(\tau = 0 \text{ } Nm = \frac{L_{f} - L_{0}}{t}\)
  - \(L_{f} - L_{0} = 0 \text{ } \frac{kgm^2}{s^2}\)
  - \(L_{0} = L_{f}\)
  - \(I_{0}\omega_{0} = I_{f}\omega_{f}\)
  - \(m{r_{0}}^2\omega_{0} = m{r_{f}}^2\omega_{f}\)
