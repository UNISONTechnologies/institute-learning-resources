- How to quantify the amount of motion an object has
  - Velocity and mass (tendency of an object to keep moving)
  - Émilie du Châtelet
    - Derived the kinetic energy formula ($\frac{1}{2}mv^2$)
  - Sir Isaac Newton
    - Derived the momentum formula
- Momentum ($P$)
  - Formula: $p = mv$
  - Unit: $\frac{kgm}{s}$ (kilogram meters over seconds)
- Newton's second law
  - Formula (assuming constant mass): $F = ma$
  - Derived formula: $F = \frac{p_{f} - p_{0}}{t}$ (the change in momentum over time)
    - Expanded: $F = \frac{m_{f}v_{f} - m_{0}v_{0}}{t}$
    - Assuming constant mass: $F = \frac{m_{f}v_{f} - m_{0}v_{0}}{t} = F = \frac{m(v_{f} - v_{0})}{t} = ma$
  - If no net force is applied to a system, then the system's change in momentum will be zero
    - **Conservation of momentum**
- $\overrightarrow{p} = m\overrightarrow{v}$
  - Momentum is a vector
- Elastic collision
  - Kinetic energy is conserved during this event
- Inelastic collision
  - Kinetic energy is **not** conserved
- $p_{f} - p_{0} = F_{net}t$
  - Impulse
  - Change in momentum
  - Units are the same as momentum
