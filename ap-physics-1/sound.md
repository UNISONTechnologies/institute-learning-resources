- Mechanical vibrations
- Speed
  - Affected by the bonding between particles
    - Strongest: solid
    - Negligible: gas
    - Speeds
      - Air (0ºC): \(331 \frac{m}{s}\)
      - Water: \(1490 \frac{m}{s}\)
      - Copper: \(3560 \frac{m}{s}\)
  - Affected by the inertia of the medium
    - Different particles at STP
      - 22.4 L of air: 28 g
      - 22.4 L of helium: 4 g
    - As temperature increases, particle density decreases
  - \(v_{\text{air}} = 331 + 0.6T\)
    - \(T\) represents the temperature in Celsius
    - 20ºC is an average classroom temperature
- Frequency = Pitch
  - Average human range: 20 - 20,000 Hz
  - Ultrasonic (higher than humans)
    - Dogs: 40 - 60,000 Hz
    - Bats: ? - 100,000 Hz
  - Infrasonic (lower than humans)
    - Elephants: 14 - 12,000 Hz
- Amplitude = Volume
  - Intensity (\(I\)): The amount of power carried by sound per square meter
    - Units: Watt per square meter (\(\frac{W}{m^2}\))
      - 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second
    - Threshold of human hearing: \(I_{0} = 1 \times 10^{-12} \frac{W}{m^2}\)
    - Instantaneous damage to eardrum: \(I = 1 \frac{W}{m^2}\)
  - Intensity level (\(\beta\)): Related to the amount of power carried by sound
    - Units: bels or decibels (dB)
      - Named after Alexander Graham Bell
    - Relationship
      - \(\beta = 10 \text{ } log \text{ } [\frac{I}{I_0}]\)
        - \(I\) is the intensity of the sound being observed
        - \(I_{0}\) is the threshold of human hearing
      - Examples
        - \(1 \times 10^{-12} \frac{W}{m^2} = 0 \text{ dB}\)
        - \(1 \frac{W}{m^2} = 120 \text{ dB}\)
- Velocity of a wave
  - Inertia (density)
  - Restoring force (e.g. tension, bonding)
  - \(v = {\lambda}f\)
    - As frequency increases, wavelength decreases, and vice versa
