## Gravitation
- Force of gravity at/near the surface of the Earth
  - Formula: \(F_{g} = ma_{g}\)
- Force of attraction between two masses (gravitation)
  - An increase in the mass causes a stronger force of gravity
  - An increase in the distance between two masses causes a weaker force of gravity
- Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation
  - Formula: \(F_{G} = G \frac{m_{1} \times m_{2}}{r^2}\)
    - \(G\) is a constant, which equals \(6.67 \times 10^{-11} \frac{Nm^{2}}{kg^{2}}\)
    - Masses in kilograms (kg)
    - \(r\) (can also be written as \(d\)) is the distance in meters
    - Returns Newtons (N)

## Electromagnetism
- Coulomb Force
  - Force between changed objects
  - Two types of charge
    - Protons (positive type)
    - Electrons (negative type)
  - Unit: 1 Coulomb (\(C\))
  - Variable: \(q \text{ or } Q\)
    - Lowercase is more popular
    - Constant: \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}\)
  - Charges
    - Protons: \(q_{p} = e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}\) 
    - Electons: \(q_{e} = -e = -1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C\) 
  - Opposite charges attract
  - Like charges repel
- Formula: \(F_{E} = k_{e} \frac{q_{1} \times q_{2}}{r^2}\)
  - \(k_{e}\) is a constant, which equals \(8.988 \times 10^{9} \frac{Nm^{2}}{C^2}\)
  - This equation is what's known as an inverse square law and is an infinite force, like Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation

## Strong Nuclear Force
- Holds nucleons/quarks together
- Extremely short-ranged

## Weak Nuclear Force
- Mediates one type of quark or lepton turning into another type of quark or lepton

## Subatomic Particles
- Protons have three "lumps", which are now known as quarks
  - Six types of quarks
    - Up and down (first generation)
    - Charm and strange
    - Top and bottom
- Leptons
  - Electron: \(e^{-}\)
  - Muon: \(\mu^{-}\)
  - Tau: \(\tau^{-}\)
- Neutrinos
  - Electron neutrino: \(\nu_{e}\)
  - Muon neutrino: \(\nu_{\mu}\)
  - Tau neutrino: \(\nu_{\tau}\)
- Quarks, leptons, and neutrinos are fundamental particles
  - There are no scientific theories that hypothesize that these particles can be divided
