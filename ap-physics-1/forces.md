## Definitions
- Inertia
    - The tendency of an object to resist changes in motion
    - Newton's First Law
- Mass ({% raw %} $$ m $$ {% endraw %})
    - A measure of inertia
    - Base unit: kilogram (kg)
- Weight
    - The pull of gravity upon something
- Force (F)
    - A push/pull
    - Measured in Newtons
- Newton (N)
    - Metric: {% raw %} $$ 1 \frac{kgm}{s^2} $$ {% endraw %}
    - Imperial: 1 lb
- Newton's Second Law
    - The amount of force you must apply, to produce a change in motion (F), depends on the system's resistance to change (m) and how large/dense the a change you're trying to produce (a)
    - Formulas: {% raw %} $$ a = \frac{F}{m} $$ {% endraw %} or {% raw %} $$ F = ma $$ {% endraw %}
- Force of Tension ({% raw %} $$ F_{t} $$ {% endraw %})
    - The force transmitted by a string, wire, etc.
- Force of Gravity/Weight ({% raw %} $$ F_{g} = ma_{g} $$ {% endraw %})
    - Near or at the surface of Earth
- Normal Force ({% raw %} $$ F_{N} $$ {% endraw %})
    - The force created by a surface, perpendicular/normal to the resistance
- Force of Friction ({% raw %} $$ F_{f} $$ {% endraw %})
    - The force exerted by a surface, parallel to that surface (compared to normal force)
    - Kinetic Friction: {% raw %} $$ F_{f} = \mu{k}F_{N} $$ {% endraw %}
        - Between two surfaces that are sliding against each other
    - Static Friction
        - Between surfaces that are not moving, relative to each other
        - Potential to be the largest friction force
        - The size of the force of static friction is influenced by the size of the applied force
        - The formula {% raw %} $$ F_{f} = \mu{s}F_{N} $$ {% endraw %} returns the maximum possible value of the force of static friction
            - It's the minimum force you need to apply before an object begins to move
- Coefficient of Friction
    - Which types of surfaces are in contact
    - Kinetic: {% raw %} $$ \mu{k} $$ {% endraw %}
    - Static: {% raw %} $$ \mu{s} $$ {% endraw %}
- Newton's Third Law
    - If object #1 exerts a force on object #2, then object #2 exerts an equal, but oppositely directed force on object #1
    - Formula: {% raw %} $$ F_{1 \text{ on } 2} = -F_{2 \text{ on } 1} $$ {% endraw %}
- Internal Forces
    - Forces which act between objects within a sysem, often holding the system together
    - Internal forces do not contribute to the net force/acceleration of the system
- External Forces
    - Forces which are applied to a system from the outside
    - External forces do contribute to the net force/acceleration of the system
- Free Body Diagram
    - A diagram that includes just one object and the forces acting on it
